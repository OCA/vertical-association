Membership categories allow to classify memberships by types, allowing a
partner to be member or not of the different categories. For example, if you
have several levels of partnership (Starter, Silver, Gold) and one product
for each one, then partners who buy Silver product will have Silver membership
category. Afterwords, you can filter Silver members.

Membership lines are created when a membership product is invoiced, like in
Odoo standard version. But now users can create a new membership line without
creating an invoice.

Also, users can edit membership line dates and state even if an invoice is
not related with it.

You will see a general membership status at partner level that specifies if
it's a member of any category or not, and also a detail status per
membership category.

To make member start date independent from the associated member one, check the
option *Adhered member* in the membership tab of the partner who is associating.
A start date will now be available to edit.
